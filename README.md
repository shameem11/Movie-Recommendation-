## Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This content-based movie recommendation system uses CountVectorizer to transform key text features (such as genres, cast, and keywords) into a matrix of token counts, representing each movie as a vector of word frequencies. Cosine similarity is then applied to these vectors to calculate similarity scores between movies, based on shared content. This similarity matrix allows the system to recommend movies that are most similar to a given movie, purely through content analysis, without relying on user preferences.
